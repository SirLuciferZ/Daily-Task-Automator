# ðŸ’¡ Motivational Quote Scheduler with Timeout

This Python script automatically delivers uplifting messages at set intervals or a designated time each day. It uses the `schedule` library to manage timed jobs and fetches random motivational quotes from the ZenQuotes APIâ€”employing a 5-second timeout to guard against long delays.

---

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

1. A job is scheduled either:
   - Every _N_ minutes or hours  
   - At a specific clock time each day  
2. When the job triggers:
   - A GET request is sent to the ZenQuotes API with a 5-second timeout  
   - The JSON response is parsed for the quote and author  
   - A custom intro is prepended to the quote  
   - The composed message is printed to the console  
   - The same message is appended (with timestamp) to `Log.txt` in the project folder

          â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–º [OUTPUT TO CONSOLE & LOG.txt] â—„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x

- `schedule`

- `requests`

Install dependencies with:

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Place the scheduler script (e.g., quote_scheduler.py) in your project directory.

2. Ensure Log.txt exists or will be created in the same folder.

3. Adjust the scheduling section in the script to your desired interval or time.

4. Start the scheduler:

```bash
python quote_scheduler.py
```

5. Watch your console for inspirational messages and check Log.txt for a running history.
